javascriptplease.com
====================

Javascriptplease.com is (or hopefully will be) the ECMAScript 6 equivalent of the html5please.com project.

This is also a community project, aiming to provide developers with an updated list of available ECMAScript 6 features and keep track of their support across browsers, and provide, where necessary, recommendations for polyfills to use.

The aim of this website will be to provide a search functionality where developers can search for a certain Javascript feature they want to use, and see when, where, and how they can use it, and whether to use a polyfill, provide fallback, or use it as is.

If at any time you think that a recommendation is incorrect, of if you think you can/would like to contribute to this project, feel free to send a pull request.
